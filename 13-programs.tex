\chapter{Use of external programs}
\label{chap-external-programs}
This chapter presents the use of the different programs of which Unitex is
composed. These programs, which can be found in the \verb+Unitex/App+ folder, are
automatically called by the interface (in fact, \verb+UnitexToolLogger+ is
actually called, in order to reduce significantly the size of the downloadable
zip file). It is possible to see the commands that have been executed by
clicking on "Info>Console". It is also possible to see the options of the different programs on "Info>Help on commands" (see Figure \ref{fig-help}). Note that that all Unitex
programs support the \verb$-h$/\verb$--help$ option.

\bigskip
\noindent WARNING: many programs use the text directory
(\verb+my_text_snt+). This directory is created by the graphical interface after
the normalization of the text. If you work with the command line, you have to
create the directory manually before the execution of the program
\verb+Normalize+.\index{Directory!text}

\bigskip
\noindent WARNING (2): whenever a parameter contains spaces, it needs to
be enclosed in quotation marks so it will not be considered as multiple
parameters.
\index{Text!directory of}\index{External programs!\verb+Normalize+}\index{\verb+Normalize+}

\bigskip
\noindent WARNING (3): many programs need an \verb+Alphabet.txt+ file. For all
those programs, this information can be omitted. In that case, a default
definition of letters is used (see \verb+u_is_letter+ 
in \verb$Unicode.cpp$ source file).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{resources/img/fig11-1a.png}
\caption{Logging configuration\label{fig-logging-config}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

You can create log files of external program launches. These log files can be useful for debugging
or regression tests. You just need to enable this feature in the Preferences frame. You have
to choose a log directory where all log files will be stored and to select the "Produce log"
check box. Clicking on the "Clear all logs" button will remove all log files contained in this directory,
if any. Then, any further program execution will produce a \verb+unitex_log_XXX.ulp+ file located in the log 
directory. \verb+XXX+ stands for the log number that can be found in the console (see next section).



\section{The console}\index{Console}
\label{section-console}
When Unitex launches an external program, the invoked command line is stored in
the console. To see it, click on ``Info>Console''. When a command emits
no error message, it is displayed with a green icon. Otherwise, the icon is a red
triangle that you can click on to see the error messages, as shown on Figure
\ref{fig-console}. This is useful when an error message occurs so fast that you
cannot read it. If a command has been logged, its log number appears in the second column.
Note that you can export all the commands diplayed in the
console to the clipboard with Ctrl+C.

\section{Text file encoding parameters}\index{Text file encoding parameters}
\label{section-text-file-encoding-parameters}
Unitex uses Unicode for text file\ref{unicode-encoding}. All program which read or write
text file share same encoding parameters. Possible format are 
utf16le-bom, utf16le-no-bom, utf16be-bom, utf16be-no-bom, utf8-bom, utf8-no-bom, 
for Unicode Big-Endian, Little-Endian and UTF-8, with or without Unicode byte order mark at the beginning of the file.
For the input format, you can specify several *-bom encoding separated by comma, but only one *-no-bom encoding.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-k=ENCODING+/\verb+--input_encoding=ENCODING+: input text file format. Can contain several value, separated by a comma;
  \item \verb+-q=ENCODING+/\verb+--output_encoding=ENCODING+: output text file format. 
\end{itemize}

By default, value are \verb+--input_encoding=utf16le-bom,utf16be-bom,utf8-bom --output_encoding=utf16le-bom+.

\index{Generation of Korean MWU dictionary}\index{Korean MWU dictionary}
\verb+BuildKrMwuDic [OPTIONS] dic+

\bigskip
\noindent This program generates a MWU dictionary graph from a text table \verb+dic+ describing each component
of each MWU.  

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS:}
\begin{itemize}
   \item \verb+-o GRF+/\verb+--output=GRF+: .grf file to produce;
   \item \verb+-d DIR+/\verb+--directory=DIR+: inflection directory containing the inflection graphs required
   to produce morphological variants of roots;
   \item \verb+-a ALPH+/\verb+--alphabet=ALPH+: alphabet file to use;
   \item \verb+-b BIN+/\verb+--binary=BIN+: .bin simple word dictionary to use.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cassys}\index{External programs!\verb+Cassys+}\index{\verb+Cassys+}
\index{Cascade of transducers}
\verb+Cassys [OPTIONS] <snt>+

\bigskip
\noindent This program applies an ordered list of grammars to a text and constructs an index of the occurrences found.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-a ALPH+/\verb+--alphabet=ALPH+: the language alphabet file
  \item \verb+-r X+/\verb+--transducer_dir=X+: take tranducer on directory X (so you don't specify full path for each transducer; note that X must be (back)slash terminated
	\item \verb+-l TRANSDUCERS_LIST+/\verb+--transducers_list=TRANSDUCERS_LIST+: the transducers list file with their output policy
	\item \verb+-s transducer.fst2+/\verb+--transducer_file=transducer.fst2+: a transducer to apply
	\item \verb+-m output_policy+/\verb+--transducer_policy=output_policy+: the output policy of the transducer specified
%//// -f FILE/--file=FILE: the snt text file
  \item \verb+-t TXT+/\verb+--text=TXT+: the text file to be modified, with extension .snt;
	\item \verb+-i+/\verb+--in_place+: mean uses the same csc/snt directories for each transducer
	\item \verb+-d+/\verb+--no_create_directory+: mean the all snt/csc directories already exist and don't need to be created
	\item \verb+-g minus+/\verb+--negation_operator=minus+: uses minus as negation operator for Unitex 2.0 graphs
	\item \verb+-g tilde+/\verb+--negation_operator=tilde+: uses tilde as negation operator (default)
	\item \verb+-h+/\verb+--help+: display this help
\end{itemize} 	

\bigskip
\noindent Cassys applies a list of grammar to a text and saves the matching sequence index in a file named \"concord.ind\" stored in the text directory.
      The target text file has to be a preprocessed snt file with its \_snt/ directory. 
      The transducer list file is a file in which each line contains the path to a transducer followed by the output policy to be applied to this transducer.

\bigskip
\noindent Instead a list file, you can specify each file and each output policy by a set of couple of -s/--transducer\_file 
      and -m/--transducer\_policy argument to enumerate the list
      
\bigskip
\noindent The policy may be MERGE or REPLACE.
      
\bigskip
\noindent The file option, the alphabet option and the transducer list file option are mandatory
     
\bigskip
\noindent As the locate pattern program, this program saves the references to the found occurrences in a file called concord.ind stored 
		in the \_snt directory of the text.
		The file concord.ind produced is in the same format as described in the chapter \ref{chap-file-formats} , but the cascade may be constituted of graphs 
applied in merge or replace mode so the \#M or \#R at the first line of the file concord.ind has no sense in this context.



\section{CheckDic}\index{External programs!\verb+CheckDic+}\index{\verb+CheckDic+}
\index{Verification of the dictionary format}\index{Dictionaries!verification}
\verb+CheckDic [OPTIONS] dic+

\bigskip
\noindent This program carries out the verification of the format of a dictionary
of DELAS or DELAF type. \verb+dic+ corresponds to the name
of the dictionary that is to be verified. 

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-f+/\verb+--delaf+: checks an inflected dictionary;
  \item \verb+-s+/\verb+--delas+: checks a non inflected dictionary;
  \item \verb+-r+/\verb+--strict+: strict syntax checking against unprotected dot and comma;
  \item \verb+-t+/\verb+--tolerate+: tolerates unprotected dot and comma (default);
  \item \verb+-n+/\verb+--no_space_warning+: tolerates spaces in
  grammatical/semantic/inflectional codes;
  \item \verb+-p+/\verb+--skip_path+: does not display the full path of the dictionary (useful 
  for consistent log files across several systems);
  \item \verb+-a ALPH+/\verb+--alphabet=ALPH+: specifies the alphabet file to
        use. 
        
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent The program checks the syntax of the lines of the dictionary. It also creates a
list of all characters occurring in the inflected and canonical forms of words in
the text, the list of grammatical codes and syntax, as well as the list of
inflection codes used. The results of the verification are stored in a file
called \verb+CHECK_DIC.TXT+.\index{File!\verb+CHECK_DIC.TXT+}

\bigskip
\noindent Selecting strict syntax checking detects using unprotected dot in
inflected form, or unprotected comma in lemma. The \verb+--tolerate+ option acts like Unitex 2.0
and lower and does not detect them.





\section{Compress}\index{External programs!\verb+Compress+}\index{\verb+Compress+}
\index{Compressing dictionaries}
\label{section-compress}
\verb+Compress [OPTIONS] dictionary+
\index{Dictionaries!DELAF}\index{Dictionaries!compressing}
\index{File!\verb+.dic+}\index{File!\verb+.bin+}\index{File!\verb+.inf+}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-o BIN+/\verb+--output=BIN+: sets the output file. By default, a file \verb+xxx.dic+ will
  produce a file \verb+xxx.bin+;
  \item \verb+-f+/\verb+--flip+: indicates
  that the inflected and canonical forms should be swapped in the compressed
  dictionary. This option is used to construct an inverse dictionary which is
  necessary for the program \verb+Reconstrucao+;
  \item \verb+-s+/\verb+--semitic+: indicates that the semitic compression algorithm should be used. Setting
  this option with semitic languages like Arabic significantly reduces the size of the output dictionary.
  \item \verb+--v1+: produces an old style .bin file
  \item \verb+--v2+: produces a new style .bin file, with no file size limitation to 16 Mb and 
  a smaller size (default)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent This program takes a DELAF dictionary as a parameter and compresses it.
The compression of a dictionary \verb+dico.dic+ produces two files:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+dico.bin+: a binary file containing the minimum automaton of the inflected forms of the dictionary;
  \item \verb+dico.inf+: a text file containing the compressed forms required for the reconstruction of the dictionary
  lines from the inflected forms contained in the automaton.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent For more details on the format of these files, see chapter
\ref{chap-file-formats}.






\section{Concord}\index{External programs!\verb+Concord+}\index{\verb+Concord+}\index{Concordance}
\index{Text!modification}\index{Modification of the text}
\verb+Concord [OPTIONS] <index>+

\bigskip
\noindent This program takes a concordance index file produced by the program
\verb+Locate+ and produces a concordance. It is also possible to produce a
modified text version taking into account the transducer outputs associated to
the occurrences. Here is the description of the parameters:

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-f FONT+/\verb+--font=FONT+: the name of the font to use if the
  output is an HTML file;
  \item \verb+-s N+/\verb+--fontsize=N+: the font size to use if the output is
  an HTML file. The font parameters are required if the output is an HTML file;
  \item \verb+--only_ambiguous+: Only displays identical occurrences with 
  ambiguous outputs, in text order.
  \item \verb+--only_matches+: this option will force empty right and left contexts.
  Moreover, if used with -t/--text, Concord will not surround matches with tabulations
  \item \verb+-l X+/\verb+--left=X+: number of characters on the left of the 
  occurrences (default=0). In Thai mode, this means the number of non-diacritic
  characters.\index{Contexts!concordance}
  \item \verb+-r X+/\verb+--right=X+: number of characters (non-diacritic ones in Thai mode) on
  the right of the occurrences (default=0). If the occurrence is shorter than
  this value, the concordance line is completed up to \verb+right+. If the occurrence is longer
  than the length defined by \verb+right+, it is nevertheless saved as whole.
  
  \bigskip
  NOTE: For both \verb+--left+ and \verb+--right+, you can add the \verb+s+
  character to stop at the first \verb+{S}+ tag. For instance, if you
  set \verb+40s+ for the left value, the left context will end at 40 characters
  at most, less if the \verb+{S}+ tag is found before.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Sort order options:}\index{Sorting!concordances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+--TO+: order in which the occurrences appear in the text
  (default);

  \item \verb+--CR+: occurrence, then right context;
  \item \verb+--RL+: right context, then left context;
  \item \verb+--RC+: left context, then occurrence.
\end{itemize}
\noindent For details on the sorting modes, see section
\ref{section-display-occurrences}.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Output options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-H+/\verb+--html+: produces a concordance in HTML format encoded in
    UTF-8\index{UTF-8} (default);
  \item \verb+-t+/\verb+--text+: produces a concordance in Unicode text format; 
  \item \verb+-g SCRIPT+/\verb+--glossanet=SCRIPT+: produces a concordance for GlossaNet
  in HTML format. The HTML file is encoded in UTF-8;\index{GlossaNet}

  \item \verb+-p SCRIPT+/\verb+--script=SCRIPT+: produces a HTML concordance
  file where occurrences are links described by \verb+SCRIPT+. For instance, if
  you use
  
  %do not remove this line jump
  \verb$-phttp://www.google.com/search?q=$, you will obtain
  a HTML concordance file where occurrences are hyperlinks to Google queries;

  \item \verb+-i+/\verb+--index+: produces an index of the concordance, made of the
    content of the occurrences (with the grammar outputs, if any), preceded by
    the positions of the occurrences in the text file given in characters;
  \item \verb+-u+ \verb+offsets+/\verb+--uima=offsets+: produces an index of the 
  concordance relative to the original text file, before any Unitex operation. Offsets 
  is supposed to be the file produced by Tokenize's \verb+--output_offsets+ option
%  the same as \verb+--index+, but the ending position of each occurrence is also given;
  \item \verb+--PRLG=X,Y+: produces a concordance for PRLG corpora where each line
  is prefixed by information extracted with Unxmlize's \verb+--PRLG+ option. X is the 
  file produced by Unxmlize's \verb+--PRLG+ option and Y is the file produced by Tokenize's
  \verb+--output_offsets+ option. Note that if this option is used in addition with \verb+-u+, 
  the Y argument oferrides the argument of \verb+-u+;
  \item \verb+-e+/\verb+--xml+: produces xml index of the concordance;
  \item \verb+-w+/\verb+--xml-with-header+: produces xml index of the concordance with full xml header;
  \item \verb+-A+/\verb+--axis+: quite the same as \verb+--index+, but the numbers
    represent the median character of each occurrence. Fore more information,
    see \cite{axis};
  \item \verb+-x+/\verb+--xalign+: another index file, used by the text alignment module.
    Each line is made of 3 integers $X$ $Y$ $Z$ followed by the content of the 
    occurrence. $X$ is the sentence number, starting from 1. $Y$ and $Z$ are the
    starting and ending positions of the occurrence in the sentence, given in
    characters;
  \item \verb+-m TXT+/\verb+--merge=TXT+: indicates to the program that it is supposed to
    produce a modified version of the text and save it in a file named
    \verb+TXT+ (see section \ref{section-modifying-text}).
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Other options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-d DIR+/\verb+--directory=DIR+: indicates to the program that
  it must not work in the same directory than \verb+<index>+ but in \verb+DIR+;
  \item \verb+-a ALPH+/\verb+--alphabet=ALPH+: alphabet file used for sorting;
  \item \verb+-T+/\verb+--thai+: option to use for Thai concordances.
  \index{Alphabet}\index{File!alphabet}
\end{itemize}

\index{File!\verb+.html+}\index{File!\verb+.txt+}
\bigskip
\noindent The result of the application of this program is a file called \verb+concord.txt+
if the concordance was constructed in text mode, a file called
\verb+concord.html+ if the output mode was \verb+--html+, \verb+--glossanet+ or
\verb$--script$, and a text file with the name defined by the user of the program 
if the program has constructed a modified version of the text.

\bigskip
\noindent In \verb+--html+ mode, the occurrence is coded as a hypertext link. The reference
associated to this link is of the form \verb+<a href="X Y Z">+. \verb+X+ et
\verb+Y+ represent the beginning and ending positions of the occurrence in
characters in the file \verb+text_name.snt+. \verb+Z+ represents the number of
the sentence in which the occurrence was found.






\section{ConcorDiff}\index{External programs!\verb+ConcorDiff+}\index{\verb+ConcorDiff+}
\verb+ConcorDiff [OPTIONS] <concor1> <concor2>+

\bigskip
\noindent This program takes two concordance files and produces an HTML page
that shows their differences (see section
\ref{section-comparing-concordances}, page \pageref{section-comparing-concordances}). 
\verb+<concor1>+ and \verb+<concor2>+ concordance index files must 
have absolute names, because Unitex uses these names to deduce on which text
there were computed.

  \item \verb+r X+/\verb+--raw=X+: indicates that Dico should just produce one
  output file X containing both simple and compound words, without requireing a
  text directory. If X is omitted, results are displayed on the standard output.

 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent
\verb+<dic_i>+ represents the path and name of
a dictionary. The dictionary must be a \verb+.bin+ dictionary (obtained with 
the \verb+Compress+ program) or a dictionary graph in the \verb+.fst2+ format (see section

  spaces. Since a newline counts as two characters and a space as a single one,
  it is necessary to know where newlines occur in the text when the positions of
  occurrences located by the \verb+Locate+ program are to be synchronized with
  the text file. File \verb+enter.pos+ is used for this by the \verb+Concord+
  program. Thanks to this, when clicking on an occurrence in a concordance, it is
  correctly selected in the text. File \verb$enter.pos$ is a binary file
  containing the list of the positions of newlines in the text.

Another usage of UnitexToolLogger is using the MzRepairUlp option to repair a corrupted ulp file (often, a crashing log):

\bigskip
\verb+UnitexToolLogger MzRepairUlp [OPTIONS] <ulpfile>+

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS after MzRepairUlp:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+-t X+/\verb+--temp=X+: uses X as filename for temporary file (<ulpfile>.build by default);
  \item \verb+-o X+/\verb+--output=X+: uses X as filename for fixed .ulp file (<ulpfile>.repair by default);
  \item \verb+-m+/\verb+--quiet+: do not emit message when running;
  \item \verb+-v+/\verb+--verbose+: emit message when running;
\end{itemize}


Another usage of UnitexToolLogger is using the CreateLog option (with round bracket) to create logfile of running Unitex program, like:

\bigskip
\noindent \verb$UnitexToolLogger { CreateLog [OPTIONS] } cmd args$

\bigskip
\noindent \verb$UnitexToolLogger { CreateLog [OPTIONS] } { cmd #1+args } { cmd #2+args } etc.$

By example,
\bigskip
\begin{verbatim}
UnitexToolLogger { CreateLog --log_file=my_run_normalize.ulp }
             Normalize "C:\My Unitex\French\Corpus\80jours.txt"
\end{verbatim}

\bigskip
\begin{verbatim}
UnitexToolLogger { CreateLog --directory=c:\logs }
                  { Compress c:\dela\mydela.dic }
                  { CheckDic --delaf c:\dela\mydela.inf }
\end{verbatim}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{OPTIONS after CreateLog:}
